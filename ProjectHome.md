**Rebeca** is based on Alice, a project originally developed at University Carnegie Mellon.

Alice is an innovative 3D programming environment that makes it easy to create an animation for telling a story, playing an interactive game, or a video to share on the web. Alice is a freely available teaching tool designed to be a student's first exposure to object-oriented programming. It allows students to learn fundamental programming concepts in the context of creating animated movies and simple video games. In Alice, 3-D objects (e.g., people, animals, and vehicles) populate a virtual world and students create a program to animate the objects.

Rebeca has focused on eliminating the **problem with the language**. For students, the interface in English can be a major difficulty to learn how to programming with a 3D environment.

Rebeca is **internationalized** to accept any language and has been translated into **Spanish**.
